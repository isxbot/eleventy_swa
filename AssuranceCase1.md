### Evidence

Evidence for C7 (E1) would include a report that would show that alerts are properly showing for any changes in user permissions and that the proper flags are sending. This report would also include a detailed list of users and the access permissions they have and if the permissions have changed since the last time the report was generated. Evidence for C5 (E3) would include a penetration test and a network connection report showing that the legacy systems are properly sandboxed and containerized. Evidence for C6 (E2) would be a log report that can be ran from kafka's pre-configured logs (ssl.enabled.protocols & ssl.protocol) that shows what versions of SSL are allowed and how they are configured.
