## Use Case - Log AggregationGreg, the system administrator needs to aggregate all of the logs from the various subsystems into a single stream to enable lower-latency processing and easier support for multiple data sources, as well as distributed data consumption. Greg needs the log data to be highly available, so that various systems can perform processes like scanning and sending to long term storage. Additionally, because log accuracy is so important, Greg needs the data to maintain its integrity.First, Greg needs to setup Kafka topics for each subsystem that will be producing relevant logs. Then, each subsystem needs to be registered as a producer to allow each system to publish log data to their relevant topic. Finally, Greg needs to setup the systems that will be processing log data as consumers of each log topic.
