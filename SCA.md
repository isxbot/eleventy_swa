# Static Code Analysis

## Review Strategy
Because Apache Kafka has a large code base, we want to focus our review efforts on security related issues. To do this we have developed the following code review strategy:
* Perform static code analysis using Codacy and SpotBugs.
* Identify security related results
* Perform manual code review on high interest results
